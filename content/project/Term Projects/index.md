## Course Project for Software design

*Dec. 2019*

Two of my classmates and I completed the handwritten number recognition software in C. At first there were many questions provided by the teacher to choose from, but my group and I chose the most difficult one because we all wanted to do something challenging and we all found the topic interesting. During this project, one person was responsible for the GUI, one person was responsible for the KNN algorithm, and I was responsible for normalizing the input written number. It was obvious that the written number could  appear in any area of the canvas. For us human, we recognized number having nothing to do with where you wrote it or the size of the number. However, for software, It would not tell the same number written on the different location of the canvas. Therefore, the normalization of the input was significant. My strategy was: first, slicing the input numbers; Second, scaling up the sliced content to the specified size using Bilinear Interpolation Algorithm. My strategy did work.

Here is the demo video:

> The input numbers in the first half of the video are written in Chinese way for the Arabic numbers 1~9.

## Microcomputer Experiments

*Jun. 2021*

Using the 8051 Instruction Set based development board provided by the college, I finished a project wholly in assembly language.

The projects materialize the following functions: 

- Function 1: Running Light.
- Function 2: Keyboard inputs 0~99 brightness level to adjust the brightness of D9. Also implements addition, subtraction, and random number-like functions.
- Function 3: Digital tubes display brightness level.

In total, I wrote hundreds of lines of code (writing code in assembly language was a novel experience) to solve the task assigned by the teacher and added additional functions such as 0~99 levels of brightness adjustment, randomly set brightness and brightness calculation to the enhancement part. Because I thought it would be funny to add additional functions to it, so I went ahead and accomplished it as far as I had conceived the idea.

Here is the demo video:
