## MY WORKS
My advisor gave me a lot of FPGA practice assignments this February and I finished them all, including FIFO, Booth Multiplier and Integrated project simulating a vending machine. Through this work, I became familiar with FPGA programming and proficient in the use of state machines. 
The China College IC competition I participated in requires me to complete an Upsampling IP, and our group has completed the preliminary round.
Since I was mainly responsible for finding and evaluating high performance SR algorithms, I did less FPGA programming works in the past few months with focusing mainly on writing neural networks in Python. 
Now that the high-performance super resolution algorithm has been found (SRLUT), I can focus on FPGA programming in the coming summer vacation.
