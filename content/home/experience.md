        I Registered my HLA typing information in the CMDPâ€™s database when I was a sophomore. Two months ago I was successfully matched with a patient in lowâ€‘resolution, and half a month ago another, wunbelievablelieveable not only because the matching probability was extremely low but also because the patients may badly need appropriate stem cells to cure their terrible disease. I guess I have the possibility to save lives. Best wishesðŸ’–

        Every year before the Chinese New Year (the most important traditional festival in China), I would visit the poorest families around my hometown with my parents and their colleagues. We bestowed them many necessities and holiday wishes. Even in 2020, the visit was completed before the outbreak of Covid-19. Through year after year of personal visits, I have also witnessed the sharp improvement of their living standards. For this experience, I was awarded a public service scholarship by the college in 2021.
