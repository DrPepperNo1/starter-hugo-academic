I am currently a junior in Huazhong University of Science and Technology pursuing a major in Microelectronic Engineering. This September, I am going to the University of California, Santabarbara to complete my final year of study for I have been granted admission to its International Program. As a not-that-smart student, I chose to be diligent and earned a 3.96/4.0 cumulative GPA in my first three years of undergraduate study, which ensured that I had a relatively solid foundation in mathematics, physics and my subject area.

My previous research and project experiences lie in various areas including Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, single image super resolution,  FPGA Programming (all learned by myself). Meanwhile, I am interested in and want to give a try to more areas such as GAN for the computer vision field, DQN for game AI, Brain-inspired Computing and Devices and so on. In my opinion, trying to foray into unfamiliar areas, gradually figuring out the rules behind them, and finally coming up with my own ideas and insights to solve problems, this series of processes in itself can give me a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. I believe it is the process that matters most rather than the outcome. I also believe once you concentrate on the process, the outcome will come consequently.

I’m applying for a graduate program or a research internship.
